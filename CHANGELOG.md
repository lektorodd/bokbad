## [1.9.0] - 2026-02-21

### Added
- **30-Day Dashboard View** — new "Last 30 Days" filter with stacked daily activity bar chart (reading vs. listening minutes) and period summary stats (days active, books finished, total time).
- **Cover Image Proxy** — ISBN-fetched cover images are now downloaded and cached locally, eliminating lag on every page load (`api/upload/proxy_cover.php`).
- **Report Issue** — 🐛 link in the overflow menu opens GitHub Issues for quick bug reporting.
- **Audiobook Position Input** — replaced plain number field with hh:mm time-position inputs for audiobook reading sessions, with a hint showing the current position.

### Changed
- **Log Reading Icon** — replaced pencil/edit icon with a clock icon to visually distinguish "Log Reading" from "Edit Book".
- **Session Validation** — page/percentage/position inputs are now validated per format before submission instead of a single generic `required` check.
- **Database Schema** — consolidated schema file now includes all migrations through v6 (user roles, display names, series & goals tables, series columns on books).

### Fixed
- Timer start button is now hidden for audiobooks (time is tracked externally).
- Removed unused legacy files (`src/counter.js`, `src/javascript.svg`).

## [1.8.0] - 2026-02-15

### Changed
- **Header** — replaced cluttered buttons with clean ⋯ overflow menu (Dark Mode, Settings, Logout)
- **Log Reading** — replaced hidden text button with floating action button (FAB) in bottom-right
- **Goal Widget** — compact inline banner with mini ring instead of large section

### Added
